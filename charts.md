## Case Acceleration

As of Tuesday, the 14-day percent increase in average new cases was:
  
  - 54% in Champaign County
  - 62% in Illinois
  - 52% in the United States
  - 8% worldwide

This chart measures how quickly the average number of new cases is increasing, or roughly, the slope of the new-cases charts above. If the case acceleration is positive, then the average number of new cases is increasing. If it is negative, then the average number of new cases is decreasing.
