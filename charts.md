During the COVID-19 pandemic, I've been making charts with data from the [Champaign-Urbana Public Health District](https://www.c-uphd.org/champaign-urbana-illinois-coronavirus-information.html), the [University of Illinois](https://go.illinois.edu/COVIDTestingData), the [Illinois Department of Public Health](http://www.dph.illinois.gov/covid19), the [CDC](https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/), [Our World in Data](https://github.com/owid/covid-19-data/tree/master/public/data) and the [COVID-19 Data Repository by the Center for Systems Science and Engineering (CSSE) at Johns Hopkins University](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19).

## Case Acceleration

As of Friday, the 14-day percent increase in average new cases was:
  
  - 43% in Champaign County
  - 47% in Illinois
  - 35% in the United States
  - 5% worldwide

![Case Acceleration](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bzigterman/CUcovid/main/gh_action/new_cases_change_facet.png)

This chart measures how quickly the average number of new cases is increasing, or roughly, the slope of the new-cases charts above. If the case acceleration is positive, then the average number of new cases is increasing. If it is negative, then the average number of new cases is decreasing.
