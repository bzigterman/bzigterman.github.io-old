During the COVID-19 pandemic, I've been making charts with data from the [Champaign-Urbana Public Health District](https://www.c-uphd.org/champaign-urbana-illinois-coronavirus-information.html), the [University of Illinois](https://go.illinois.edu/COVIDTestingData), the [Illinois Department of Public Health](http://www.dph.illinois.gov/covid19) and the [CDC](https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/).

Community transmission levels are calculated by the CDC based on new cases per capita in the past week and test positivity.
