title: The ABC7 Chicago I-Team ripped off my work
---

For more than two years, I covered the disappearance of visiting University of Illinois scholar Yingying Zhang and the federal death penalty trial of her murderer, Brendt Christensen.

I routinely broke stories in this case, often prompting other outlets to write follow-up articles. In most cases, they properly cited my reporting at The Champaign News-Gazette or did their own work based on the court documents I found.

But in one case, the well-known I-Team at ABC7 Chicago led by Chuck Goudie and Barb Markoff directly ripped off [my work](https://www.news-gazette.com/news/christensen-s-lawyers-detail-mental-health-issues-including-homicidal-thoughts/article_72ec95df-a6e1-590c-8943-5a0bf4dc5cd9.html), leaving [whole paragraphs untouched](https://www.diffchecker.com/d9ibom3u) in [its report](https://www.bzigterman.com/images/abc.jpg).

After our general counsel contacted ABC7, it took down [the article](https://abc7chicago.com/5242468/).

    Thank you for bringing this issue to our attention.  Although our team based their reporting on the newly-released court documents, in consideration of your concerns we have removed the report from our website.

    Sincerely,
    Jennifer Graves
    VP of News
    ABC 7 Chicago
